DESCRIPTION
Are you interested in shaping the future of entertainment? Do you want to define the next generation of how and what Amazon customers are watching? Prime Video is changing the way people watch movies and TV. From one service, we’re delivering versatile ways to watch hundreds of thousands of movies, TV series, and live events on the web, mobile, and TV. Our service is available in more than 200 territories globally, and we’re just getting started.

Working closely with business and technology partners, we use research, design, and prototyping to guide early product development, bring clarity to engineering goals, and develop a customer-centric point of view. This is where you come in.

As a Senior Design Technologist, you'll be a key part of our UX design organization. Your role will be all about proving, advancing, and evolving cutting-edge UX concepts through prototyping and hands-on product work. You'll work alongside other design technologists to bring design ideas (interactions, visuals, motion) to life.

Key job responsibilities
- Build high-quality, functional prototypes that convey and advance the vision of future products
- Collaborate with design leadership and key stakeholders throughout the product lifecycle
- Work alongside designers, researchers, PMs, and engineers to drive concepts from idea to implementation

Our team is open to experimenting with new technologies and evaluating them to see if they are the right tool for the job. We elevate designers’ visions and support our engineering partners to help them ship faster.

OverviewHelp build the world’s most advanced multimodal dataset at Microsoft AI We are on a mission to create the largest and most advanced multimodal dataset in the world. This dataset, spanning all modalities from across the web and beyond, will power the training of the world’s most capable AI frontier models, pushing the boundaries of scale, performance, and product deployment.  The AI Data team at Microsoft AI is responsible for all aspects of data preparation to support our model pre-training operations, including collecting data from the source, extracting and transforming the most useful data, and understanding the impact of changes to data by training and evaluating new models. We are an interdisciplinary team of engineers and scientists, learning from each other, and collaborating to create the best models and products. We work closely with the teams that transform pre-trained models into the models that power the consumer Copilot experience.  We are looking for outstanding individuals excited about contributing to the next generation of systems that will transform the field. In particular, we are looking for candidates who: Are passionate about the role of data in large-scale AI model training Will thrive in a highly collaborative, fast-paced environment Have a high degree of craftsmanship and pay close attention to details Demonstrate a proactive attitude and enthusiasm for exploring new methods and technologies Effectively manage multiple responsibilities and can adjust to shifting priorities.  Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.QualificationsRequired Qualifications:  Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Math, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, or related field AND 8+ years experience in business analytics, data science, software development, data modeling or data engineering work OR Master's Degree in Computer Science, Math, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, or related field AND 6+ year(s) experience in business analytics, data science, software development, or data engineering work OR equivalent experience. Preferred Qualifications: Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Math, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, or related field AND 15+ years experience in business analytics, data science, software development, data modeling or data engineering work OR Master's Degree in Computer Science, Math, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, or related field AND 12+ years of business analytics, data science, software development, data modeling or data engineering work experience OR equivalent experience. Data Engineering IC6 - The typical base pay range for this role across the U.S. is USD $161,600 - $286,200 per year.
